When provisioning your EC2 instance, make sure to enable SSH port 22 in the security inbound rules.
Then connect from SSH Client and make sure to change permission using chmod 400
If you are unable SSH to the EC2 server from the description using Ubuntu, then switch to power shell and Run thesame command. It will work.
